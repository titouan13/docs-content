When you [create your Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/create-load-balancer/), you set up one [frontend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#frontends) and one [backend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#backends) (which is attached to one or several backend servers). This page shows you how you can add additional frontends and backends to your Load Balancer, for example to balance several different applications by creating frontends listening on different ports each of which forwards traffic to its own backend or set of backends.
