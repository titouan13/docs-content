When you create a Load Balancer, you can either add frontends and backends during the initial creation process, or you can create your Load Balancer without any frontends or backends and add them later. This page explains how to create and configure frontends and backends for your Load Balancer at any stage.

## How to create a frontend during creation of your Load Balancer

1. Follow the steps for [creating a Load Balancer](TODO). At the last stage, click **Add frontend and backend**. The following screen displays, inviting you to configure a frontend:

        <Lightbox src="TODO" alt="" />

2. Enter a **name** for your frontend. TODO conditions?

3. Enter a **port** number. The frontend will listen on this port, and forward the requests it receives from clients to the backend(s). Note that you cannot add an SSL certificate at this stage, but you can [add one after the creation of the Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate/). Similarly, you will be able to [enable HTTP/3](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/http2-http3/#configuring-your-load-balancer-for-http3) after adding a certificate. TODO add help on choosing port.

4. Continue to the next section for [creating a backend](TODO). You will finalise creation of your frontend and backend at the same time, at the end of this section.
