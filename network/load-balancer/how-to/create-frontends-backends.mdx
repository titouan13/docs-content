When you create a Load Balancer, you can either add frontends and backends during the initial creation process, or you can create your Load Balancer without any frontends or backends and add them later. This page explains how to create and configure frontends and backends for your Load Balancer at any stage.

## How to create a frontend during creation of your Load Balancer

1. Follow the steps for [creating a Load Balancer](TODO). At the last stage, click **Add frontend and backend**. The following screen displays, inviting you to configure a frontend:

        <Lightbox src="TODO" alt="" />

2. Enter a **name** for your frontend. TODO conditions?

3. Enter a **port** number. The frontend will listen on this port, and forward the requests it receives from clients to the backend(s). Note that you cannot add an SSL certificate at this stage, but you can [add one after the creation of the Load Balancer](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate/). Similarly, you will be able to [enable HTTP/3](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/http2-http3/#configuring-your-load-balancer-for-http3) after adding a certificate. TODO add help on choosing port.

4. Continue to the next section for [creating a backend](TODO). You will finalise creation of your frontend and backend at the same time, at the end of this section.

## How to create a backend during creation of your Load Balancer

Follow the steps for [creating a Load Balancer and creating a frontend](TODO). After configuring your frontend, the next section of the screen displays as shown below, inviting you to congfigure a backend:

        <Lightbox src="TODO" alt="" />

### Configuring basic settings

1. Enter a **name** for your backend. TODO conditions?

2. Enter a **protocol** and **port** for your backend. The Load Balancer initiates connections to its backend servers using the protocol and port you define here. Available protocols are **HTTP** or **TCP**. 

3. Choose whether to activate **TLS encryption** (default setting is deactivated), to encrypt connections between the Load Balancer and its backend servers.

4. Choose whether to activate **proxy protocol** (default setting is deactivated), to transfer connection information from the client through the Load Balancer and on to the destination backend server. If you choose to activate proxy protocol, you are prompted to select the **version** to use.

Continue to the next section for configuring traffic management in your backend.

### Configuring traffic management

1. Select a **balancing method**. This determines how the backend distributes requests between its backend servers. The following methods are available:
        * **Round-robin (default)**: Requests are sent to each backend server in turn.
        * **Least connections**: Requests are forwarded to the backend server with the fewest current connections. 
        * **First available** : Requests are forwarded to the first backend server with available connection slots.

2. Add the **IP addresses** of the servers the Load Balancer will forward requests/connections to. These will be your backend servers.

3. Choose whether to activate **sticky sessions** (default setting is deactivate). Sticky sessions enable the Load Blanacer to bind a given user's sessions to a specific backend server. If you choose to activate sticky sessions, you are prompted to select either **IP-based** (clients IPs are used to bind sessions) or **cookie-based** (an HTTP cookie is used to bind sessions, and you must choose a name for the cookie).

4. Choose whether to edit more settings for traffic managemnet by clicking the **Additional settings** button. Otherwise, these settings will be left at the recommended default values.

        <Message type="tip">
            For more help choosing traffic management settings for your backend, including additional settings such timeout values, backend protection values, retry values and an S3 failover, see our [dedicated reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-load-balancer).
        </Message>

Continue to the next section for configuring health checks.

### Configuring health checks

Health checks are regular, automized attempts by the Load Balancer to communicate with backend servers. This ensures that servers are listening and healthy.

1. Select a health check **type**. Various protocols are available, including HTTP, TLS, MYSQL, and more. Depending on the health check type you choose, you may be prompted to enter additional information according to that health check type.

2. TODO: check which settings are visible regardless of the health check type.

3. Choose whether to edit more settings for health checks by clicking the **Advanced settings** button. Otherwise, these settings will be left at the recommend default values. 

        <Message type="tip">
            For more help setting up health checks for your backend, including advanced settings such defining intervals between healthchecks, timeout values and the unhealthy threshold, see our [dedicated reference documentation](TODO).

### Confirming creation of your frontend and backend

When you are happy with the configuration of your frontend and backend, click **Create frontend and backend** at the bottom of the page to finish.



## How to create a frontend after creation of your Load Balancer

1. Click **Load Balancers** in the **Network** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Load Balancer dashboard displays.

2. Click the Load Balancer you want to add frontends to. The Load Balancer information page displays.

3. Click the **Frontends** tab.

4. Click the green **+** button.
    <Lightbox src="scaleway-add-frontends.webp" />

5. Enter a **name**, **port** and (if necessary) [**SSL certificate(s)**](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate) for your new frontend. Note that each frontend must listen on a different port. For help configuring your frontend, see our [dedicated reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-load-balancer).

        TODO check these steps:

6. Choose between **using an existing backend** or **creating a new backend**.
    - If using an existing backend, click **Use an existing Backend** and select the backend of your choice from the dropdown list.
    - If creating a new backend, click **Create a new Backend** and enter the required information and advanced settings as required. For help configuring your backend, see our [dedicated reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-load-balancer)

7. Under **Advanced Settings**, optionally use the <Icon name="toggle" /> to enable HTTP/3. The availability of this setting depends on your [Load Balancer's configuration](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/http2-http3/)

8. Click **Create Frontend**.

7. Configure your Load Balancer's **[frontend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#frontends)** by entering a **name** and a **port**. 

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-configure-frontend.webp" alt="" /> 

8. Configure your Load Balancer's **[backend](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#backends)** by entering a **name**, and the **protocol** and **port** it should use to connect to the backend servers. Choose whether to activate **TLS encryption** and select also a **proxy** protocol option, **health check** method and add the **server IPs** (one or many) of the backend server(s) it should direct traffic to.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-configure-backend.webp" alt="" /> 

    Depending on the options you choose, you may be prompted for additional configurations such as the **Verify certificate** setting if you activate TLS encryption. 

    For more information on choosing configuration settings for your Load Balancer's backend, see our [dedicated reference documentation](/network/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-load-balancer).

9. Configure **advanced settings** if required:
    - **S3 failover**: activate the feature and enter a Scaleway Object Storage [Bucket Website](/storage/object/concepts/#bucket-website) URL (e.g. `https://my-bucket.s3-website.nl-ams.scw.cloud`). If none of your backend servers are available, users will be redirected to this page. 
      <Message type="note">
        The S3 failover feature is only available for Load Balancers using the HTTP protocol on their backend. Find out more about setting up a static website with Object Storage in our [dedicated documentation](/storage/object/how-to/use-bucket-website/).
      </Message>
    - **[Sticky session](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#sticky-session)**: activate the feature if you want a particular user session to stick to the same backend server. This is useful if your users need their requests to be served by a single server in order to maintain a consistent session. If relevant, you will be prompted to enter the name for a cookie that will bind users' sessions to specific backend servers. 

10. Click **Create a Load Balancer**.

<Message type="note">
You can [add additional frontends and backends](/network/load-balancer/how-to/manage-frontends-and-backends/) to your Load Balancer after its creation.
</Message>

## Load Balancer limitations

The following technical limitations apply when using the Load Balancers product:

- Your external [highly available IP address](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#highly-available-ip-address) can only be IPv4. However it is possible to use IPv6 between your Load Balancer and backend servers.
- Each Load Balancer supports only one highly available frontend IP.

For further information, refer to the [Load Balancers FAQ](https://www.scaleway.com/en/faq/load-balancer/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/).
