Health checks are regular, automized attempts by the Load Balancer to communicate with backend servers. This ensures that servers are listening and healthy.


1. Select a health check **type**. Various protocols are available, including HTTP, TLS, MYSQL, and more. Depending on the health check type you choose, you may be prompted to enter additional information according to that health check type.

2. TODO: check which settings are visible regardless of the health check type.

3. Choose whether to edit more settings for health checks by clicking the **Advanced settings** button. Otherwise, these settings will be left at the recommend default values.
