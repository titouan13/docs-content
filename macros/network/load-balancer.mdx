Load Balancers allow you to distribute traffic and workload across multiple backend servers. They make it easy to scale your applications while ensuring continuous availability even in the event of heavy traffic. Each Load Balancer that you create is a highly available and fully managed Instance, consisting of one or more frontends and one or more backends. You can configure your Load Balancer according to your needs.
